ReeveOS Operator Isolation Layer
================================
GDPR/ICO/HIPAA compliant data isolation for self-employed operators.

Layers ON TOP of existing tenant isolation (tenant.py):
  1. tenant.py ensures user can access the business
  2. THIS ensures operators can ONLY see their own data within that business

Rules:
  - Salon Owner (mothership): sees ALL operators' data within their business
  - Operator: sees ONLY their own clients, bookings, revenue, forms
  - Platform Admin: sees everything (unchanged)
  - Operators CANNOT see other operators' data. Period.
  - Operators CANNOT see business-wide revenue totals.
  - Client records are operator-scoped: shared clients have SEPARATE records per operator.

This file provides:
  - get_operator_scope() — returns operator_id if caller is an operator, None if owner/admin
  - scope_query() — adds operator_id filter to any MongoDB query
  - OperatorContext dataclass — injected into request lifecycle
