"""
Rezvo Tenant Isolation Layer
============================
Makes cross-tenant data leakage STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

Three interlocking defenses:
1. TenantContext (ContextVar) — set per-request, unavoidable
2. verify_business_access — validates business_id against user's allowed businesses
3. TenantScopedDB — auto-injects businessId into EVERY query

A developer CANNOT write an unscoped query. The system adds the filter
at a level no route handler can bypass.
